Peer Review
1.Doom AI:
Even though the AI could only complete 3 static levels, I thought it was awesome to go back and build
an AI to play a game from the early 90s. In particular, their demo was really awesome as it displayed
the bot playing through all the levels.
2.Engineering the Perfect Monkey:
As with Doom, I thought the idea of getting a bot to play a SNES Donkey Kong game was awesome. I found it
particularly impressive that Toby worked on the project by himself, and had to build the entire system
for the bot to interact with a SNES emulator on top of building the AI.
3.Fantasy Football
This project by Jose Suarez-Rodriguez and Oluwasanya Oluwafemi was really similar to ours and thus I found it 
intriguing to compare results. I wanna say our predictive models had better results in terms of point
production, but learning about how others approached the same problem was very interesting.
